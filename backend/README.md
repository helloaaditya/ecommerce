A Node.js/Express backend for the ShopHub e-commerce platform.

# ðŸš€ Render Deployment Instructions

## Required Environment Variables
Create these in the Render dashboard under Environment > Environment Variables:
- `PORT` (Render sets this automatically, but you can set a default)
- `NODE_ENV` (set to `production`)
- `MONGODB_URI` (your MongoDB Atlas connection string)
- `JWT_SECRET` (a strong secret for JWT)
- `FRONTEND_URL` (your deployed frontend URL, e.g., https://your-frontend.vercel.app)
- `EMAIL_USER` (your email for nodemailer)
- `EMAIL_PASS` (your app password for nodemailer)

## Steps to Deploy on Render
1. Push your backend code to GitHub.
2. Go to https://dashboard.render.com/ and create a new Web Service.
3. Connect your GitHub repo and select the backend folder as the root directory.
4. Set the **Start Command** to `npm start`.
5. Add all required environment variables.
6. Click **Create Web Service** and wait for deployment.
7. After deployment, note your Render backend URL (e.g., https://your-backend.onrender.com).
8. Update your frontend to use this backend URL for API requests.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash

2. Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with the following variables:
   ```env
   # Server Configuration
   PORT=5000
   NODE_ENV=development

   # MongoDB Configuration
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/ecommerce

   # JWT Configuration
   JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production

   # Frontend URL
   FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173

   # Email Configuration (Gmail)
   EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
   ```

3. For Gmail email setup:
   - Enable 2-factor authentication on your Gmail account
   - Generate an App Password
   - Use the App Password in EMAIL_PASS instead of your regular password

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Password Reset Flow

1. User requests password reset via `/forgot-password` page
2. System generates a secure token and sends email
3. User clicks link in email to go to `/reset-password/:token`
4. User enters new password and submits
5. System validates token and updates password
6. User is redirected to login page

## Email Templates

The system includes:
- Welcome email for new registrations
- Password reset email with secure link

Both emails are professionally designed with ShopHub branding.
